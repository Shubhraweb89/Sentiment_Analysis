Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Comments Using NLP
Introduction
This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze and classify sentiments in Twitter comments as positive, negative, or neutral. The goal is to provide actionable insights into public opinions, trends, and feedback, which can be valuable for businesses, researchers, and social media analysts.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries and Frameworks:
NLP and Text Processing: NLTK, SpaCy
Machine Learning/Deep Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras
Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Twitter API: For collecting live Twitter comments.
Cloud Platform (Optional): For deployment (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud).
Dataset
Source: Tweets are fetched using the Twitter API.
Format: JSON/CSV file containing fields like Tweet, Timestamp, and Sentiment.
Preprocessing Steps:
Remove stop words, special characters, URLs, and mentions.
Tokenize and lemmatize text.
Handle emojis and slang.
Installation and Setup
